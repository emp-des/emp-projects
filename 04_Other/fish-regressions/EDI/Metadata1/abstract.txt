This dataset is a compilation of length-weight regression coefficients for fish species commonly found in the freshwater tidal habitats of the San Francisco Estuary. This effort was born out of the Delta Smelt Resiliency Strategy Aquatic Weed Control Action study, which, in order to calculate fish biomass, needed to calculate individual fish weights from their measured lengths. The Aquatic Weed Control study was supported by Interagency Ecological Program through the Endangered Species Act and is included in the Interagency Ecological Program 2017-2019 workplan. Weight is estimated from length using the exponential function W=a*L^b. These can be calculated using the linear regression of the log-transformed equation
(log⁡(W)=log⁡(a)+b*log(L)). This dataset provides the species-specific a and b parameters.  Associated publication(s) and relevant metadata information are included. Data was obtained either via database (fishbase.us) or peer-reviewed scientific papers.
